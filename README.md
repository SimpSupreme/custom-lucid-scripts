# custom-lucid-scripts
My collection of slightly less awfully coded scripts for the Lucid Roblox external, if/when I use AI I'll make it obvious.

# Supported Games
- [Grave/Digger](https://www.roblox.com/games/18259975825/Grave-Digger)

# TO DO
- Rewrites
  - Pressure
  - Doors
- Scorched Earth (maybe not, it's pretty good and obfuscated)
- No Big Deal (I just need an acc with VC)
- Absolvement
- Twenty One (not sure how to do this one ngl)
- Regretevator (maybe, maybe not, there's a lotta stuff and a lot of it is RNG to get and test)
